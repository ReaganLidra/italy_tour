It is mainly made of calcium carbonate (more than 90% of its structure), which is very common in nature and gives its characteristic white color. In its natural form and as part of the outermost layer of the earth’s crust, white marble comes as a large irregular solid mass which, when processed, has a medium to coarse-grained texture. Its production and handling, however, is relatively simple. Once it is subjected to the abrasion polishing process, it achieves a stunning natural shine that gives it a feeling of purity and simplicity so characteristic and appealing.</p>

                                                <br>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, a traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza recipe is tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil which represent the colors of the Italian flag – white cheese, green basil and red tomato. Margherita pizza gets its name after the Queen of Italy of the same name who ruled in the late 1800s ‘Margherita di Savoia’. </br>

Rather, you'll have to know beforehand that Sangiovese is the dominant grape variety in Chianti blends and the only one permitted in Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Sangiovese generally boasts elevated acidity and assertive tannins, flavors of cherries, herbs like sage and rosemary, savory notes of leather and tobacco, and in riper vintages, plums. Some Sangiovese also contribute hints of violets. And as it ages, Sangiovese can evolve notes of blood oranges and bay leaves.</p>

It’s a luxury, sport and style expressed through unique cars. It was made by Alfieri Maserati who started the company with his brothers to revolutionize the automotive industry in Bologna, Italy.

                            <br>The impact of tourism on the economy emerged as a result of supply and demand relationships in the industry. It is caused by the emergence of tourist spending patterns of visitors , and the investment generated by the transaction is tourism which in turn leads to a change in the economic structure of a country.</br>
                             <br>The economic benefits derived from tourism are multifaceted and contribute significantly to a country's overall prosperity. In the case of Italy, tourism has emerged as a formidable pillar of economic support, accounting for a substantial 10.2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022. This financial injection plays a pivotal role in fostering economic growth by not only infusing capital into various sectors but also by creating employment opportunities for the local populace.</br>
                            <br> Tax revenue is another critical aspect of the economic windfall facilitated by tourism.The money spent by tourists contributes to government coffers through taxes on accommodations, services, and goods. Providing tax revenue, brings new infrastructure to the region, thereby enhancing the overall quality of life for residents. It also provides an opening for local small businesses in the informal sectors ( the part of any economy that is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government.) 
                            Indirect effect also has also occurred with tourism / people outside Italy having employed 14.7% of the workforce (2017) in the italian economy.</br>
                            <br>
                            Moreover, the impact of tourism extends beyond the formal economy. The sector often serves as a gateway for the growth of local small businesses operating in the informal sector—businesses that operate outside the purview of government taxation and monitoring. This informal economy, driven by the demands of tourism, becomes an essential component in sustaining the livelihoods of many local entrepreneurs.
                            </br>
                            <br>In conclusion tourism is very beneficial for italy economic growth whether it is on the opportunity, work force , or other things.tourism plays a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape.  Without the continued influx of tourists, Italy's economy would undoubtedly face significant challenges. Thus, the sustained importance of tourism remains a cornerstone of Italy's economic strategy, underlining the necessity of fostering and promoting this vital industry for the nation's continued well-being and development.</br>
                        <br>There are many economical benefits tourist gives to a country such as, supporting economics growth ( tourist contributes up to 10.2% of GDP in italy in 2022 ) this includes,  lowering unemployment by making jobs opportunity for locals.This, in turn, leads to a decrease in unemployment rates as locals find gainful employment within the burgeoning tourism industry. Consequently, tourism becomes a catalyst for job creation, addressing one of the key economic challenges faced by many nations.</br>
